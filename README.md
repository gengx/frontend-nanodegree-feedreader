# Project Overview

This project is part of the Udacity's Front-end Web Development Nanodegree courses that I took during 2017/11-2018/5. The purpose of this project was to practice using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test our Javascript code.

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer already included Jasmine and started writing the first test but did not finish. We were asked to add some tests to complete the test suites.

## RSS Feeds Reader
The application reads the RSS feeds from multiple external API resources using asynchronous AJAX calls and renders them on a web page. Choosing a different source from a menu will rewrite the page with new feeds.


## File structure

The javascript code is located under the js/ directory, and the test suites are located under jasmine/ directory. The main html file is index.html located under the project root directory. It includes both the main page of the feed reader application and the Jasmine test results. The css and fonts directory includes assets needed to render the page.
